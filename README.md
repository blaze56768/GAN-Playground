# GAN-Playground
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as a playground for understanding and experimenting with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The notebook provides a step-by-step guide to the concepts and implementation of GANs.

Overview
GANs are a type of neural network architecture used to generate synthetic data, such as images, that resemble real-world data. The core idea behind GANs involves two networks, a Generator and a Discriminator, which are trained simultaneously. The Generator attempts to create realistic data, while the Discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data.

This notebook walks through:

Theoretical concepts of GANs, including how the Generator and Discriminator work.
Step-by-step implementation of a basic GAN using a deep learning framework (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow).
Training loop explanation, covering how the two networks compete with each other during training.
Visualizations to track the progression of generated samples over epochs.
Extensions and ideas for improving GAN performance, such as DCGAN or conditional GANs.
Features
Clear explanations of GANs and how they work.
Fully functional implementation of a basic GAN.
Sample generation after each training epoch to observe progress.
Code structured in an easy-to-follow format for both beginners and intermediate users.
